新年计划作为一项强力的工具可以帮助你将你的技能提升到更高的层次。

但它也会起到让你精疲力竭以至于锐气尽失的反作用。

我曾通过对新年进行规划得到不少收获，但我也会适当的排除掉某些计划。

在本文中，我将告诉你如何规避新年计划中的一些常见问题。

我会提供一些关于如何选择目标计划“合适尺寸”的小建议。

我将会讨论：

1.  **通过对新年进行规划而取得成功的开发者们的三大共同点**
2.  **为你选择合适目标的提示**
3.  **我所建议的一些开发者们新年共同努力的目标。**

简言之，这篇文章将会为你提供启动辉煌成功的2020年所需的的一切。

## 新年计划对于开发者来说真的有用么？

计划类似于一种“承诺机制”，是你对于未来自我的约束。

计划是你达成目标的一个非常实在且强力的工具。
我这儿有三个关于达成新年计划的建议：

-   选择切合实际的计划
-   对定好的计划负责
-   为计划寻求支持

让我们对这三点建议进行详细延伸，并对这三点进行有针对性地练习直到可以通过全面检查。

## 因素 #1：相关性-你真的在乎你定制的新年计划么？

如果你的新年计划是写一个你自己的编译器，那你最好对编译器抱有兴趣。

如果你的新年计划是进一步深入机器学习领域，那你应该早早的基于兴趣阅读有关神经网络的论文。

你的计划必须同你密切相关对你有一定意义，并且你需要从中得到或学到某些东西。

如果你心中对此并没抱有热情，那你就没法产生那么多激情来保持专注来让你真正坐下来投入工作。

### 练习时间

现在，请闭上你的眼睛。（当然是在你阅读完本练习的剩余部分再闭眼。😉）

想象一下几个月后已经完成计划的自己。

有什么不同么？你感觉自己如何了呢？

好的——让我们来尝试一下。闭上你的眼睛然后执行以上步骤。

很好。我现在假设你已经做完以上步骤了。

那么现在——如果通过此次练习你没感觉到你的脸颊上露出微笑 ，尽管我不想否定你，但这个目标可能并不是让你最兴奋的那个。

你需要不停的集思广益直到你找到那个能让你脸上露出笑容的那个决定。

切记不要理会那些人对于不同工具或项目的夸张宣传，建立目标是个人的事。别让任何人来指点你的梦想是什么

## 因素 #2：责任感-你真的相信自己可以做到么？

一旦你将你的新年计划公开——通过告诉你的家人或是通过社交网络宣布这件事儿——你成功将自己推进了坑。你正在告诉全世界你要达成这项计划。

在公众面前作出承诺后偶尔反悔一次两次很正常。我也这样，大多数开发者也这样，失败并不致命。

但你需要小心点儿，别让你说出来的目标轻如鸿毛。你得用大半的时间来兑现你承诺的目标。不然人们该对你的伟大宣言不屑一顾了。

记住，新年的目标完全由你自由规划。你完全不需要把你自己陷在一个你完全不想去做的目标上。

当然，公开计划的风险和收益并存。如果你能成功利用公众监督的力量，那么新年计划可以帮助你更上一层楼。

### 练习时间

回忆一下你在过去许下的诺言。

你是否有尚未兑现的承诺呢？

你的这些承诺还有执行的价值么？

如果有的话，那你可能需要先解决掉那些未履行的承诺，再通过新年计划将更多的目标加入你的规划中。

Now think about your resolution. Is it a long shot? Or is it something you can already visualize yourself doing?



Remember that developers are notoriously bad at time estimation.

It's better to set a modest goal than trap yourself in a self-imposed death march.

## Factor #3: Support - Can You Leverage Positive Peer Pressure?

The final factor is social. Do you have friends who can embark upon the resolution alongside you?

Awesome. This is the way to go. You can help keep one another motivated.

Or do you at least have friends who understand what you're trying to accomplish so they can cheer you on?

This is important. Because if your goal is to - say - create an entire website using only C++, or to reach 1 kyu on Code Wars in less than a year - people may not understand that goal or why it's challenging.

Don't make it any harder for people to care about whether you succeed.

This positive peer pressure can be critical. When you are extremely busy with work, or you're sick, or you've had a major life change - how are you going to stay motivated?

Most often, it's the people in our lives who keep us pushing forward. We don't want to let them down.

So find a peer group - or even curious family member - and get them to earnestly root for you in your quest.

(And note that the 3 challenges I recommend at the end of this article each come with their own peer groups.)

### Last exercise. I promise.

Think about the person whom you'd most like to care about your resolution. Once you have someone picked out, read on.

OK - now imagine how you would explain your resolution to this person.

How would you get them to care enough to ask, "How's your resolution going?" from time to time.

## Quincy's New Year's Resolution Tips for Developers

Now that you have a good idea of what makes a successful New Year's Resolution, here are a couple tips to make life easier for you.

## Tip #1: A year is too long. Timebox your resolution to 3 months instead.

The whole point of a New Year's Resolution is to bring about a positive, sustained change in yourself.

The key word is  **sustained**.

For some people, that change could be getting into shape, or getting out of debt.

For an ambitious developer, that change could be learning a new tool or contributing to a new open source project.

In order for the change to be sustained, it has to be systematic.

And that's where habits come in.

You don't need to do something for an entire year to build a habit. A few months will suffice.

So I recommend setting your New Year's Resolution to end before April. Then you can catch your breath and assess whether this is something you want to continue.

## Tip #2: Figure out a way to make your resolution an unavoidable part of your day

Think about your future self - coming home tired at the end of the day, just wanting to watch a show or play some games.

How can you set your future self up for success?

By working your resolution into your daily routine, you no longer have to think about it as much.

If your gym is on the way home from work, you can just pull over and go in and work out. There's no more, "Oops - I forgot to do it."

The same thing works with coding:

-   Use daily recurring reminders. And yes - you should ideally be working on this every day at around the same time of day.
-   Use tools to block access to distracting websites during the time of day when you're working on your resolution. This can help you stay focused.

## Tip #3: When in doubt, use a ready-made peer group and a ready-made challenge

If you've read this far and still aren't sure what your New Year's Resolution should be, no worries. I have 3 great options for you. You can just follow their rules, use their hashtags, and get started immediately.

## The #100DaysOfCode Challenge

This is the granddaddy of coding challenges. It wasn't originally designed for New Year's Resolutions. But January has become the most popular start time.

Here's  [everything you need to know about the #100DaysOfCode challenge][11]  \- including its history and how to get started.

## The #AWSCertified Challenge

AWS offers several cloud certifications, and they're a great addition to your résumé or CV. They can help you steer your career in a more DevOps (or Site Reliability Engineer) direction.

By the end of this challenge, you'll be both an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and a AWS Certified Solutions Architect.

freeCodeCamp has free courses to prepare you for both of these. (Shout-out to  [Andrew Brown at ExamPro][12]  who designed these courses and has graciously made them free to the public through  [our YouTube channel][13]).

The rules:

1.  Tweet out a photo of yourself giving a thumbs-up and announcing that you are committing to the #AWSCertified challenge.
2.  Each day tweet at least one time about your progress and what you've learned or done, using the #AWSCertified hashtag
3.  Each day, reply with encouragement to at least 2 other people who are also using the #AWSCertified hashtag.
4.  Each time you earn a certification, print it out and pose with it.

That's it. Unlike #100DaysOfCode, there is no set end date to this. It's over when it's over. Which should only be a few months if you're working each day toward this.

Note that unlike the other two challenges I mention here, this challenge does cost money. Even though all the learning resources are free, once you're ready to take the exams, you will have to spend a few hundred dollars on examination fees.

Here are those video courses I was telling you about. For the Certified Cloud Practitioner:

## The #ProjectEuler100 Challenge - The "Dark Souls" of New Year's Resolutions

And for all the developers out there who love a challenge, I've created a brand new challenge for your New Year's Resolution.

This will really force you to expand your math and computer science horizons.

It is totally do-able by a new developer. Thousands of people have completed the first 100 Project Euler problems over the years.

It's just brutally hard.

I love Project Euler and used it extensively when I was first learning to code. I love it so much that we added all 600+ Project Euler challenges to freeCodeCamp's Interview Preparation section.

These 600+ challenges get progressively harder - to the point where even people with math PhD's still struggle with them.

But again, the first 100 are do-able for a lay person with some willingness to go down Wikipedia rabbit holes.

So what do you think. Are you up for working through the first 100 Project Euler problems by the end of 2020?

Here's how the challenge works:

1.  Tweet out a photo of yourself giving a thumbs-up and announcing that you are committing to the #ProjectEuler100 challenge.
2.  Create a Git repository.
3.  Each time you complete a challenge, add your solution to your Git repository and tweet a link to it using the #ProjectEuler100 hashtag.
4.  Then scroll through the #ProjectEuler100 hashtag and give supportive feedback on at least 2 tweets from other developers.
5.  Move on to the next Project Euler challenge. You can't skip ahead. You have to complete all 100 challenges in order. But you can use any programming language you want to solve these.
6.  Once you've finished all 100 of them, tweet out a celebration photo. You will have taught yourself a ton of math and computer science, and gotten a lot of programming practice along the way.

You can use the 20-year-old Project Euler website itself. Or you can use the freeCodeCamp.org version - which lets you code right in your browser, and has built-in tests.

Remember: you can look at other people's explanations of these Project Euler challenges, but do not copy other people's code directly. You will be tempted to take shortcuts. Resist the temptation. You'll be glad you did.

# Whatever New Year's Resolution you make, stick with it.

The power of New Year's Resolutions lies in their binding commitment. But if you can leverage this power, you can accomplish so much in 2020.

Happy New Year. And Happy Coding.
